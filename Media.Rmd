## IASCL Media Coordinator

In January 2023 I became the Media Coordinator for the [IASCL](https://www.childlanguage.org/) (International Association for the Study of Child Language). I take care of the IASCL website as well as social media sites, including pages on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalAssociationForTheStudyOfChildLanguage), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iascl_childlang/), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/iasclchildlang.bsky.social), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iascl/). I also conduct video interviews with child language researchers that can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@childlanguage).

# Blogs

I've written about the ManyBabies-AtHome project for the International Association for the Study of Child Language (IASCL) blog series, titled [Collecting child language data online using eye-tracking](https://www.childlanguage.org/blog/ly8fs3g7bz8h17h7dregyfqvt3ozu1).

[Cogtales](https://cogtales.wordpress.com/), is "a blog by young female cognitive scientists" that I've contributed to, writing a guide for [writing effective introductory emails](https://cogtales.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/how-to-write-effective-introductory-emails/).
