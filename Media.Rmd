# Media Articles

- My alma mater, the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, has written a few articles about me, both [generally](https://news.uwgb.edu/featured/alumni/05/30/alumni-rising-research-sparks-international-career-for-von-holzen/) and in the [Psychology Department](https://blog.uwgb.edu/uwgbpsych/featured-alumnus-katie-von-holzen/).
- In 2010, I won a [Graduate Scholarship from the Phi Eta Sigma National Honor Society](https://news.uwgb.edu/log-news/releases/05/11/graduate-scholarship-1081/) to support my graduate studies in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.
- In 2009, I won a [Summer Research Grant from the Psi Chi Honor Society](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/apspsi-chi-summer-research-grant-winners#.WNqK42-GOUk) to work at Dartmouth College.
