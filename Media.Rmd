## IASCL Media Coordinator

Starting in January 2023 I became the Media Coordinator for the International Association for the Study of Child Language (IASCL). I curate the Association's social media pages on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalAssociationForTheStudyOfChildLanguage/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/IASCL_ChildLang) and the [Association's website](https://www.childlanguage.org/). I also started a video interview series, which can be found on the website's [Resources for Researchers](https://www.childlanguage.org/resources-for-researchers/#YouTubeInterviews).

# Blogs

I've written about the ManyBabies-AtHome project for the International Association for the Study of Child Language (IASCL) blog series, titled [Collecting child language data online using eye-tracking](https://www.childlanguage.org/blog/ly8fs3g7bz8h17h7dregyfqvt3ozu1).

[Cogtales](https://cogtales.wordpress.com/), is "a blog by young female cognitive scientists" that I've contributed to, writing a guide for [writing effective introductory emails](https://cogtales.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/how-to-write-effective-introductory-emails/).
