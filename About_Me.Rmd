In April 2022 I joined the English Linguistics department of [Holger Hopp](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/anglistik/seminar/linguistik/team/hopp) at the Technical University of Braunschweig. I'm working towards my Habilitation in speech segmentation abilities in *ab initio* and L2 learners. I also lead the DFG-funded [Ini-Seg Project](ini-seg.de).

In January 2023 I became the Media Coordinator for the [IASCL](https://www.childlanguage.org/) (International Association for the Study of Child Language). I take care of the IASCL website as well as social media sites, including pages on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InternationalAssociationForTheStudyOfChildLanguage), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iascl_childlang/), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/iasclchildlang.bsky.social), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iascl/). I also conduct video interviews with child language researchers that can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@childlanguage).

From 2019-2022 I was an Akademische Rätin (senior postdoctoral researcher) in the German Linguistics department of [Sarah Schimke](http://www.schimke.germanistik.tu-dortmund.de/cms/de/home/Mitarbeiter/Professorin/Schimke.html) at the Technical University of Dortmund. I taught classes in German Linguistics, Bilingualism, and Psycho- and Neurolinguistics.

From 2017-2019 I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Maryland. Together with [Rochelle Newman](https://hesp.umd.edu/facultyprofile/newman/rochelle), I'm investigating how infants, toddlers, and adults begin to learn a foreign language at first exposure. I'm especially interested in how L1 knowledge helps and hinders this process.

From 2014-2017, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher working at the Université Paris Descartes with [Thierry Nazzi](https://incc-paris.fr/people/thierry-nazzi/). I investigated how infants process consonants and vowels during early word learning and recognition.  I was especially interested in how this processing changes over the first year of life and how this relates to later language outcomes.

In 2013 I completed my PhD at the Georg-August-Universität-Göttingen under the supervision of [Nivedita Mani](https://www.psych.uni-goettingen.de/en/lang/team/mani-nivedita). My dissertation focused on how bilingual adults and toddlers activate words from both of their languages during lexical processing.
