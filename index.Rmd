I'm a researcher in developmental psycholinguistics, currently working at the Technical University of Dortmund in Germany. I've bounced all over the world since I started my PhD in Göttingen, Germany in 2010. You can read a brief summary of what I've worked on along the way under the [About Me](About_Me.html) tab. For a quick summary of my curriculum vitae, go to [CV](CV.html). You can find more about my current and past projects under the [Projects](Projects.html) tab. I've taught several different classes in Psychology and Linguistics, you can check out some of my approaches under the [Teaching](Teaching.html) tab. I've also put together different tutorials and datasets, including a [meta-analysis](https://psyarxiv.com/dze29/) with [Christina Bergmann](https://sites.google.com/site/chbergma/). You can find out more under the [Resources](Resources.html) tab. Finally, I've been covered in the media a few times and written a few blog posts, which you can read under the [Media](Medial.html) tab.
