abstract = {The Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) database is an end-to-end, freely available auditory and production data set for speech and psycholinguistic research, providing time-aligned stimulus recordings for 26,793 words and 9592 pseudowords, and response data for 227,179 auditory lexical decisions from 231 unique monolingual English listeners. In addition to the experimental data, we provide many precompiled listener- and item-level descriptor variables. This data set makes it easy to explore responses, build and test theories, and compare a wide range of models. We present summary statistics and analyses.},

@article{McQueen1996,
abstract = {The use of the word-spotting task in psycholinguistic research is summarised. When word spotting, listeners hear a list of nonsense words, some of which contain embedded real words. Their task is to detect those embedded words. The task was designed to study the segmentation of continuous speech, since it requires listeners to segment the words out of the nonsense contexts. The task has also been used to examine the process of competition between lexical hypotheses during the recognition of spoken words. A description of the task, a summary of its advantages and disadvantages, and references to those studies which have used the task are provided. {\textcopyright} 1996 Psychology Press, an imprint of Erlbaum (UK) Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},
